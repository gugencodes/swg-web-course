    <!--
    Use block elements to create a landing page for Cosmo's Pet Cutz, 
        an independent pet grooming business.

    You'll need:
    1. A div element. Your other elements will go *inside* this div.
    2. Put a second level heading (h2) inside the div, 
        with the text content: Cosmo's Pet Cutz
    3. After the heading, add a paragraph element. 
        Describe Cosmo's services inside the paragraph.

    Create only the three required elements, no more.
